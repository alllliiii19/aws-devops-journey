# DevOps Culture & Philosophy

## 📖 Introduction
DevOps is not a title or a specific tool; it is a cultural shift and a set of practices that bridge the gap between Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops). This document covers the theoretical underpinnings of the movement.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 1. The C.A.L.M.S. Framework
*   **Culture:** Focus on people, communication, and psychological safety.
*   **Automation:** Remove toil to allow humans to focus on high-value work.
*   **Lean:** Continuous improvement and small batch sizes (Value Stream Mapping).
*   **Measurement:** Use data (metrics) to drive decisions.
*   **Sharing:** Knowledge transfer and dismantling silos.

### 2. The "Three Ways" (Gene Kim)
1.  **Systems Thinking (Left to Right):** Optimizing the flow of work from Development to Operations to the Customer. (Avoid local optimization).
2.  **Amplify Feedback Loops (Right to Left):** Creating short feedback loops from Ops/Customer back to Dev to fix issues faster.
3.  **Culture of Experimentation:** Fostering a culture where taking risks and learning from failure is encouraged (mastery through repetition).

### 3. Conway's Law
> "Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."
*   **Theory:** To change your software architecture (e.g., to Microservices), you must change your organizational structure (Reverse Conway Maneuver).
